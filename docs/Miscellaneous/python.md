# Pyinstaller
 
There are no more words needed for python's fast reproduction and redistribution of source codes to developers and researchers. However, the *executable* package distribution is not the main scope of python. Unlikely many compile languages(C/C++, Rust, ... ), the execution of python source code requires python environment and dependent packages. Have you ever seen any program requiring a compiler and libraries that the developer pawns off on users? Of course, some scientific programs or mass-size products, like games, demand some prerequisites but the most of dependencies are automatically installed. Moreover, for general users, constructing these environments is usually a merciless demand. 

Pyinstaller is one solution of python distibution. There are other solutions about distibution of executable program.

See details of usage in official [documents](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/)
