# LED Array Design for Uniform Irradiation

Optimize the LED array location for uniform irradiation intensity on target plane.


**Duties**:

* Developed boundary-center matching algorithm for preventing boundary falling problem.
* Implemented the kernel estimation method and the approximation solution routines for illumination equation.
* Constructed calculation program and module for engineering applications
