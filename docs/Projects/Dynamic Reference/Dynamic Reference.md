An annotation scheme for citation function
Simone Teufel Advaith Siddharthan Dan Tidhar

>Citations play a central role in the process of writing
>a paper. Swales (1990) argues that scientific writing
>follows a general rhetorical argumentation structure:
>researchers must justify that their paper makes a con-
>tribution to the knowledge in their discipline. Several
>argumentation steps are required to make this justifica-
>tion work, e.g., the statement of their specific goal in
>the paper (Myers, 1992). Importantly, the authors also
>must relate their current work to previous research, and
>acknowledge previous knowledge claims; this is done
>with a formal citation, and with language connecting
>the citation to the argument, e.g., statements of usage of
>other people’s approaches (often near textual segments
>in the paper where these approaches are described), and
>statements of contrast with them (particularly in the
>discussion or related work sections). We argue that the
>automatic recognition of citation function is interest-
>ing for two reasons: a) it serves to build better citation
>indexers and b) in the long run, it will help constrain
>interpretations of the overall argumentative structure of
>a scientific paper.

## Wolfram MathWorld

Editor: Eric W. Weisstein
    All materials except few articles from contributors are written by him.

Page contents:

    Author, Reference, Citation information.

Typo, New articles: 

    Using suggestion form to send a message to editor team.
    https://mathworld.wolfram.com/contact/

Note: It doesn't provides access date for citation. It is because this page managed by editor team who are experts of mathematics discilpine. 

## NIST

Eiditors Board exists: https://dlmf.nist.gov/about/staff

All materials are written by Chpater Authors and checked by
Editors. 

Feedback of correctness: Using e-mail notification for maintain team

## EOM

Eiditors Board exists: https://encyclopediaofmath.org/wiki/Editorial_Board

Articles in EoM should contain substantial encyclopedic content, which satisfies the following requirements:

    correctness
    completeness
    clarity
    verifiability (references for statements should be given, possibly with links)

The editorial board, under the management of the European Mathematical Society, monitors any changes of articles and has full scientific authority over alterations and deletions.
